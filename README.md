*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The application had a requiremnt for users to login, set a goal weight, and add daily wieghts. The user this app was designed for is a user trying to track his.her weight to a goal weight. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Login and registrations screens were necessary to login the user, then we have a main UI that generates pupup window to set the uinital goal weigh and we included a fab that triggers another popup to enter weight data.  The weight data is astored in a grid that loads a seperate layout in a grid view. I wanted to keep the UI clean and intuitive to make it easy for the user to know what does what.  For the most part I think the design was successful.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached developing this application with a goal oriented mindset.  There were particular requirments I was attempting to hit and I tried to make sure each requiremnt was considered and addressed. I used an agile methodology for the implementations, I made changes, tested and revisited untill I felt it was usable then moved on to other components.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested iteratively.  Essentially I added functionality, tested, if it diding work i went back to make changes and test again.  If it did work I added other functionality and tested again.  I kept this process to the completion of the project.  I like to work iteratively like this (especially in a tech stack that is new to me) as it allow to make course corrections.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The implementation of the GridView with a different layout itme was challenging as it did not allow click events from Main activity,  I did research online and founf that the use of a listener infterface which was implemented in Main Activity might work.  It did

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the app in general shows knowledge skills and experience. This was the first Android Studio app that i have created and to have a full app utilizing a database is a very good start I believe.  I am particularly pround of how I handles the girdView and inplemented another layout with buttong to edit and delete each particular event.
